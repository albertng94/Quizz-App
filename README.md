Project to create a Quiz App (from the "React - The Complete Guide 2024 (incl. Next.js, Redux)" course from Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller in Udemy).

**About the project:** This project corresponds to section 12 of the mentioned course and was performed completely autonoumously by me with the exception of two features:
- The "index.css" file which came given as it was not the objective of the project to focus on the styling.
- The progress bar functionality ("Question" and "ProgressBar" components), for which I required to look into Maximilian's solution and take ideas to adapt it into mine, as I got stuck for a long period and was lacking some knowledge.

The main goal of the project was to create a Quiz-like web application which is controlled by a progress bar timer and passes through all the questions linearly to end up displaying a summary with the user's selections and results.

**Built with:**
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- React

**Accomplishments:**
- Improved the knowledge of the "setTimeOut" and "setInterval" JavaScript methods.
- Learned about the Context API ("useContext" hook) to solve Prop Drilling.
- Learned about the importance of using the "useReducer" hook to simplify the code of state updating functions.
- Learned about the importance of using the "useEffect" and "useCallback" hooks to solve potentially dangerous side effects.
- Learned it is possible to use a "key" prop within a sub-component to update it completely when the parent component's state is updated, but only if the key's value changes.
